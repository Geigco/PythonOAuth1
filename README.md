# PythonOAuth1
This is a simple place to share example scritps that I use to test oAuth functionality.

To use OAuth1 you will need a key and a secret.  Think of this as a Usernamae and password.  Keep the secret... secret!

Once you have your key/secret you can reuse this to authenticate your client application.

There are different steps depending on your application.
Currently this script only uses the first oAuth1 step.  "Initiate" is used to pass in your key/secret (known as a consumer key) and get back a request token (a secondary key/secret) used to get a final bearer token.

For now we just do the initial step.

Maybe they can help somebody out.  They are meant to be very simple examples to show people whom new to a concept.
